# hello-world
My first try
Hello again, I'm Raul i'm a proffesional full stack developer, working my ass off as a Senior software developer at Google
I've started without any relevant degree, no bootcamp just real hard work trying to figure out how to code, filter all the informations provided by the internet on my own and chose what courses are best for me in order to accomplish my goal. Although, the odds weren't in my favors, my dedication and ambition drive me reaching my full potential as a developer.
